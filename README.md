= Rubython

== Why

It's kind of a little strange when came back to Python after working with Ruby for about one year. So this idea of adding corresponding methods to Python Classes came into my mind.

== What

RbArray

RbHash (dictionary in Python)

RbString

RbFixnum

RbBlock

(more contents will be added)
